Enemies
Five enemy types inspired by graphics of nature, particularly trees and woodland creatures...

Five Enemy Types Inspired by Graphics of Nature:
Entwined Sprites
- Description: These ethereal beings are formed from twisting vines and branches, resembling humanoid figures. They possess the ability to summon thorny tendrils and launch ranged attacks.
- Strategy: Coordinate with your VR companion to cut down their vines and target their weak points, while also commanding your troops to keep their distance from their ranged attacks.
Mossy Treants
- Description: Moss-covered treants emerge from the earth, towering over players and casting spells to entangle and slow down the heroes. Their bark-like skin acts as natural armor.
- Strategy: Focus your attacks on their vulnerable roots while using your troops to distract and chip away at their defenses. Coordinate with your VR companion to unleash powerful spells to breach their bark armor.
Fey Sylphs
- Description: Agile and elusive, these woodland spirits appear as shimmering, ephemeral figures made of leaves and petals. They can summon gusts of wind to disorient players and their armies.
- Strategy: Use quick reflexes and precise attacks to catch the fey sylphs. Encourage your troops to shield themselves from the gusts while you and your companion coordinate to close in and engage in close combat.
Thornbound Stags
- Description: Massive, antlered stags covered in sharp thorns charge at players and their armies with incredible speed. Their charging attacks can deal massive damage.
- Strategy: Coordinate with your companion to create barriers and traps to slow down the charging stags. Send your troops to engage them at a distance while you target their thorn-covered hides.
Will-o'-the-Wisps
- Description: Mischievous orbs of light flit through the forest, leading players and their armies astray. When threatened, they unleash blinding bursts of light that disorient and confuse.
- Strategy: Work closely with your VR companion to decipher the paths through the forest. Command your troops to stay vigilant and protect against the blinding light. Once you locate the wisps, use your abilities to capture or dispel them.

Players start with a health bar that represents their own well-being.

Army Health:
Each player has an army with its own collective health pool.
Army health is displayed as a bar or a number alongside the player's HUD.
Armies can be healed by the player using a special ability or by finding army-specific health power-ups.

The world itself is represented by the Harmony Core, a magical crystal at the center of Harmonyhaven.
The Harmony Core has its own health bar, representing the well-being of the village.
Players must protect the Harmony Core from damage caused by enemy attacks or events in the game world.
